# 2048 Game [DEMO LINK](https://vanyachyzh.github.io/game_2048/)
This is a browser-based implementation of the popular 2048 game using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and SCSS. The game is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, making it easy to maintain and extend.

##Game Rules
The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. Players move tiles in one of four directions - up, down, left, or right - and any adjacent tiles with the same number will be merged into a single tile with the sum of their values. The game is over when there are no more possible moves or the player reaches the 2048 tile.

##Getting Started
To run the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game interface will load automatically, and you can start playing right away.

##How to Play
Use the arrow keys or swipe gestures to move the tiles in any of the four directions: up, down, left, or right.
Tiles with the same number will be merged into a single tile with the sum of their values.
The game ends when the player reaches the 2048 tile or there are no more possible moves.
